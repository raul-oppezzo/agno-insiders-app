    Follow these instructions carefully:
    
    - use the **extract_text_from_url** tool to get the text content of the document.
    - analyze ALL the content carafully to identify the company, ALL the governaning bodies, ALL the insiders and ALL the roles mentioned.
    - extract ALL the required data about the company, the governing bodies and the insiders.
    - the data you extract should be as complete and accurate as possible, but you can only use the information available in the document.
    - create a list of roles for each insider, including the name of the insider, the name of the governing body (if the role belongs to a governing body), the title of the position, and the date of first appointment.
    - think to the roles as relationships between the insider and the company or governing body, it is very important to include the name of the insider, the name of the governing body (if the case) and the title of the role.
    - some directors may have more authoritative roles in the board of directors, such as 'chairman' or 'lead independent director', if so skip the 'director' role and add the more authoritative ones.
    - some roles may not have a governing body, in that case, leave the governing_body field empty, it means that the role is within the company but not part of a specific governing body.
    - the role title should be as specific as possible, e.g., 'executive director', 'lead independent director', 'alternate auditor', 'CO-General-Manager', etc.
    - if some data is not available, you can return `null` for that field. BUT be sure that it is really NOT available.
    - all the dates should be returned in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., '2025-01-31').

# - work_experience: the work experience of the insider (if available)
# - be sure to include all the governing bodies (in the positions list) to which the insider is member of or chairs (such as internal committees, board of statutory auditors, etc.).
# - some positions may not have a governing body, in that case, leave the governing_body field empty.
# - the short biography should be a brief summary (few sentences) of the insider's career, e.g. 'Mario Rossi is an Italian physicist, academic, and manager appointed CEO of Leonardo on 9 May 2023. He previously served as minister for ecological transition in the Italian cabinet, ...'
