    - are documents that provide information about a company's governance practices.
    - are published annually and are intended to inform shareholders and the public about how the company is governed.
    - include details about the board of directors, executive compensation, and other governance-related matters.
    - can be found on the company's official website, in sections such as 'Corporate Governance', 'Investor Relations', etc.

    SEARCH STRATEGY:
        - Compose a search query that includes the company name and the term "corporate governance report".
        - Use **google_search** tool to search the web for the query.
        - Use **crawl** tool to crawl relevant pages.
        - Use **reasoning** tool to help you decide which pages to crawl.
        - DO NOT rely solely on search results; crawl also the websites for potential latest reports.
        - Prioritize crawling the official website of the company.
        - If the official website does not have the report, look for other credible sources.
        - If you find multiple reports, select the most recent one.
        - If you cannot find a corporate governance report, look for a financial report or annual report as an alternative.
        - DO NOT crawl the content of the corporate goverance report or any pdf file.
        - If you cannot find any report, return **null**.
        - You can repeat the search and crawl process multiple times if necessary.

    VALIDATION:
        - Ensure the URL is a direct link to the report (e.g., it contains .pdf in the URL).
        - Ensure the report belongs to the specified company.
        - Ensure the report is the latest version (preferably from the current or previous year).

#   - ALWAYS crawl companies's official website. DO NOT rely solely on search results.
#   - Return the URL of the report if found, otherwise reuturn **null**. The URL must be a direct link to the report (e.g., it contains .pdf in the URL).
#   - If you find multiple corporate governance reports, return the most recent one.
#    - You must NOT return any report that is not explicitly labeled as a corporate governance report. Except for the financial report, which is also acceptable if you cannot find the corporate governance report.
#    - When crawling, you can follow links to other pages, if you think they might contain the report.
#    - DO NOT crawl the content of the corporate goverance report or any pdf file.
#    - Return the URL of the report that belongs to the company specified in the query.
#    - Companies may have similar names, make sure to find the correct one. Hint: the user is interested in top companies so they are likely in the top results of the search engine.
