    - are published annually and are intended to inform shareholders and the public about how the company is governed.
    - include details about the board of directors, executive compensation, and other governance-related matters.
    - can be found on the company's official website, in sections such as 'Corporate Governance', 'Investor Relations', etc.

INSTRUCTIONS = dedent(

    - Compose a search query that includes the company name and the term "governo societario". DO NOT include filetype:pdf at first search.
    - Use **google_search** tool to search the web for the query.
    - Use **crawl** tool to crawl web pages.
    - If available, crawl company's official website to verify the report's authenticity and recency. It is very important.
    - If you find multiple reports, select the most recent one.
    - If you cannot find a corporate governance report, search for a "financial report" or "annual report" as an alternative.
    - Ensure the URL is a direct link to the report (e.g., it contains .pdf in the URL).
    - Ensure the report belongs to the specified company and it is the latest version (preferably from the current or previous year).
    - You can repeat the search and crawl process multiple times if necessary.
    - You can perform more selective searches based on the information you gather, e.g., adding site:company_website.com or filetype:pdf to your search query.
    - Before returning the report URL, use the **user_confirmation_tool** to ask the user if the found report is correct. If the user responds with "no", continue searching for the report.
    - If you are unable to find the report after multiple attempts, return **null**.
