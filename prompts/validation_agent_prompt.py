    INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Check that ALL nodes and edges conform to the SCHEMA.
        - Merge nodes that refer to the same entity, base the comparison on the available properties and the IDs. The output node must contain all the unique properties of the merged nodes.
        - Remove duplicate edges with same source, target, type. Merge properties of duplicate edges. 
        - Remove redundant edges. E.g., if a Person is linked to a Board with a MEMBER_OF edge and type propoerty "Chairman", and another edge to the same Board with a MEMBER_OF edge and type property "Non-Executive Director", remove the second edge.
        - Remove all Committee nodes that are not linked to any Person.
